# web_to_epub
Just a new-newbie personal project to read offline webnovels done with online tutorials.

I've added an exe file in dist folder, so you can try the script by using the .exe file. Just double click on it after you've downloaded the "dist" folder. (I think you can do it by downloading the zip of the whole rep, I think).

Or, you could also execute the 'epub_converter.py' file from the cmd using Python ie writing "python epub_converter.py", you will need to install the necessary modules though. You can also do that with the CMD: "pip install [module name]". (You will be notified of the lacking modules by the script itself)

As of now, you should only be able to safely(?) download novels from RoyalRoad and WuxiaWorld.

It works most of times, but during my tests I found that several times the program failed because it took too much time downloading the files. In that case, I can only suggest to retry, maybe closing some background apps will help. I made few tests, and downloading around 1300 chapters of Overgeared took around 20 minutes, so yeah. Please be patient.

If you find bugs, errors or simply have suggestions or even requests, do not hesitate to tell me so. I'm very unexperience with Github and programming in general and of course I'm very busy with real life, so sorry if I will not reply or address issues soon. I mean, I'm really doing this just to make it easier for me to read stuff offline to be honest. Though it's interesting and funny to try to make it workable for other people as well.
