# web_to_epub
Just a new-newbie personal project to read offline webnovels done with online tutorials

You need to execute the 'epub_converter.py' file from the cmd using Python.

As of now, you should only be able to safely(?) download novels from RoyalRoad. Ignore the parser choice WuxiaWorld, as I'm working on that.

It works most of times, but during my tests I found that several times the program failed because it took too much time downloading the files. In that case, I can only suggest to retry, maybe closing some background apps will help.
