# web_to_epub
Just a new-newbie personal project to read offline webnovels done with online tutorials.

<strong>I'm experiencing some bugs with the chapter ordering when downloading many chapters, will try to fix it asap</strong>

<strong>Just get the .exe file or the .py (execute them on your IDE or with the CMD using Python, ie writing "python epub_converter.py") files (need both epub_converter.py AND functions.py)</strong> and it should prompt a CMD window from which you should be able to download and make epubs of online novels by following instructions (just copy paste ToC/Chapter link and choose whether you want it all downloaded or if you prefer a specific range of chapters).

If you make use of the py files, you will need to install the necessary modules though. You can also do that with the CMD: "pip install [module name]" (You will be notified of the lacking modules by the script itself). Naturally, you need the "functions.py" file in the same directory as "epub_converter.py" for it to work properly.

As of now, you should only be able to safely(?) download novels from RoyalRoad and WuxiaWorld.

It works most of times, but during my tests I found that several times the program failed because it took too much time downloading the files. In that case, I can only suggest to retry, maybe closing some background apps will help. I made few tests, and downloading around 1300 chapters of Overgeared took around 20 minutes, so yeah. Please be patient.

If you find bugs, errors or simply have suggestions or even requests, do not hesitate to tell me so. I'm very unexperienced with Github and programming in general and of course I'm very busy with real life, so sorry if I will not reply or address issues soon. I mean, I'm really doing this just to make it easier for me to read stuff offline to be honest. Though it's interesting and funny to try to make it workable for other people as well.
