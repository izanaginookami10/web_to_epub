# web_to_epub
Just a new-newbie personal project to read offline webnovels done with online tutorials.

I've added an exe file in dist folder, so you can try the script by using the .exe file. Just double click on it after you've downloaded the "dist" folder. (I think you can do it by downloading the zip of the whole rep, I think).

Or, you could also execute the 'epub_converter.py' file from the cmd using Python ie writing "pythong epub_converter.py", you will need to install the necessary modules though. You can also do that with the CMD: "pip install [module name]". 

As of now, you should only be able to safely(?) download novels from RoyalRoad and WuxiaWorld.

It works most of times, but during my tests I found that several times the program failed because it took too much time downloading the files. In that case, I can only suggest to retry, maybe closing some background apps will help.

Also, say no more, I know: I need to format it better, but bear with just a simple weeb who want to read his webnovels offline whenever and wherever.
